# Tunix - 32-bit RiskV OS

Follows the tutorial at https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en/14-system-call.

The following extra features have been implemented:
- None so far

These following extra features are to be implemented:
- Freeing up resources when a process terminates
- Running multiple processes at once
- Threading
- Timer Interruption based scheduling (almost works! other process just should not get locked into supervisor mode on waiting...)
- A smarter scheduler than round-robin scheduling
- Mallocing / Freeing heap memory
- A reasonable filesystem
- Proper interrupt handling / process blocking when waiting for e.g. I/O (and not just shutting system down...)

## Requirements

```
brew install llvm lld qemu
```

Check that
```
clang -print-targets | grep riscv32
```
returns something. If not, you should use the clang located at `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang` (or similar).

Potentially optional:
```
If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/tmey/.zshrc

For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"
```
