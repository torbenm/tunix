# TorbOS - 32-but RiskV OS


## Requirements

```
brew install llvm lld qemu
```

Check that
```
clang -print-targets | grep riscv32
```
returns something. If not, you should use the clang located at `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang` (or similar).

Potentially optional:
```
If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/tmey/.zshrc

For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"
```
